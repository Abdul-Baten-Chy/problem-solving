// 3.Task: Function Composition
// Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.

const square = (x) => x * x;
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const addFive = (x) => x + 5;
const composeFunctions = (x) => {
  return addFive(double(square(x)));
};
const result = composeFunctions(3);
console.log(result);
